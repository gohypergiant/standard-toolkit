# Accelint - Standard Toolkit - Documentation Website 

This documentation website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/)

## Up and running

### Installation

```
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```
pnpm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

> [!WARNING]
> other packages must be built for the docs site to work correctly. be sure to run the global build script.

### Build

```
pnpm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Features

### Robust markdown support

See all of the markdown features in docusaurus [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)

### JSDoc parsing via typedoc

We use [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) to generate documentation from comments and markdown documents within our packages. Those generated docs live in the `/docs/typedoc` directory.

the [autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated) docusaurus feature makes integrating the typedoc output into the site very straightforward.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not modify content in `/docs/typedoc` directly. To rerun typedoc, run the following command:
>
> ```
> pnpm run build:typedoc
> ```

### Search

For now, we are using the [@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local#readme) library. If/when we outgrow a local search approach, we can explore other options like [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/), which is recommended in the [docusaurus search docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search)

> [!INFO]
> Local search does not work in dev mode. the search index is created at build time. to test search locally, you can run the `build` script followed by the `serve` script
