# Development Toolkit - Documentation Website

This documentation website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/)

## Up and running

### Installation

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

> [!WARNING]
> other packages must be built for the docs site to work correctly. be sure to run the global build script.

### Build

```shell
pnpm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Features

### Robust markdown support

See all of the markdown features in [docusaurus features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)

### JSDoc parsing via typedoc

We use [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) to generate documentation from comments and markdown documents within our packages. Those generated docs live in the `/content/api` directory.

the [autogenerated](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated) docusaurus feature makes integrating the `typedoc` output into the site very straightforward.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not modify content in `/content/api` directly. To rerun `typedoc`, run the following command:
>
> ```shell
> pnpm run build:typedoc
> ```

### Search

For now, we are using the [@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local#readme) library. If/when we outgrow a local search approach, we can explore other options like [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/), which is recommended in the [docusaurus search docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search)

> [!NOTE]
> Local search does not work in dev mode. the search index is created at build time. to test search locally, you can run the `build` script followed by the `serve` script

## Potential Future Features

- [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog)

## Notes

- There are three Docusaurus groupings that can house content: pages (can NOT have a sidebar), docs, and blog. We will primarily use docs as our content organization grouping strategy in Docusaurus.
  - Pages (src/pages)
    - Highest priority for resolution, it seems, because with the default page set to `content/README.md` if `src/pages/index.md` exists `content/README.md` will not be displayed as the landing page
  - Docs (`docs/` renamed to `content/`)
