# Welcome

The DevTK project serves as a centralized repository for all reusable code modules that do not provide a competitive advantage or differentiating factors. This enables Accelint companies to accelerate product development through economies of scale through code reuse.

There are two high-level categories that modules fall into: [Design System Components](packages/design-system) (and utilities) and data transformation libraries (everything else).
