# Modules

Modules are a collection of components that create sections or page-level objects within the user interface.

Modules _can_ import other modules if necessary; however, this practice should be limited to avoid circular dependencies and confusion regarding their responsibilities and functionalities. Modules **should not** import from the `data-access/*` folder and must **not** include a suspense boundary. Optionally, you may include an error boundary.

From an [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) perspective, you can think of a module as anything that falls between an [organism](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#organisms) and a [template](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#templates).
