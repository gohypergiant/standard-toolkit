> **IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: If a user mentions "Core", "Design Toolkit", "DTK", or asks you to build UI with this design system, you MUST read this entire document and linked pages in the Table of Contents before writing any code. This ensures correct component usage, proper imports, and adherence to design guidelines.

## Table of Contents

1. [JS/TS Style and Conventions](./1.style.md)
2. [React Style and Conventions](./2.react.md)
3. [Testing Style and Conventions](./3.testing.md)
4. [Component Style and Conventions](./4.components.md)
5. [Ecosystem Guidelines](./5.ecosystem.md)

## Workflow

### Research → Plan → Implement

Follow this sequence for every task:

1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan; verify with the user
3. **Implement**: Execute with validation checkpoints

Say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions, use **ultrathink**: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### When Stuck

1. **Stop** — Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** — Spawn agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** — Engage maximum reasoning capacity
4. **Simplify** — The simple solution is usually correct
5. **Ask** — "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

### Reality Checkpoints

Stop and validate:

- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"

> **For AI Assistants:** This document contains everything needed to correctly use the Accelint design system (Design Toolkit). Always reference this guide when implementing UI with Design Toolkit components. When in doubt, use the documented patterns and follow the rules strictly.
