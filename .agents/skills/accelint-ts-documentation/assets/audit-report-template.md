# Documentation Audit Report: [Target Name]

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THIS TEMPLATE:

1. Replace [Target Name] with the file(s)/module being audited

2. FINDINGS STRUCTURE:
   - Each finding should be numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Don't group issues - document each one individually
   - Focus on showing the before/after clearly

3. EACH FINDING MUST INCLUDE:
   - Clear title describing the issue
   - Location (file:line)
   - Current code with ❌ marker
   - Clear explanation of the issue (bullet points)
   - Category (see categories below)
   - Reference (which references/*.md file)
   - Recommended Fix with ✅ marker

4. CATEGORIES:
   - Missing Documentation: Exported APIs with no JSDoc at all
   - Incomplete Documentation: JSDoc missing @param, @returns, @example, @throws, etc.
   - Incorrect Syntax: Wrong JSDoc syntax (@example without code fence, malformed tags)
   - Quality Improvements: Comment markers, placement, removing obvious comments
   - Internal Documentation: Non-obvious internal code needing explanation

5. REFERENCES:
   - jsdoc.md - For JSDoc-related issues (missing, incomplete, incorrect syntax)
   - comments.md - For inline comments, markers (TODO/FIXME), comment quality

6. SUMMARY TABLE:
   - Keep it concise - one row per finding
   - Should match the numbered findings above

See this file for a complete example of what a real audit looks like.
