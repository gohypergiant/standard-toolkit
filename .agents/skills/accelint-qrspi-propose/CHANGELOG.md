# Changelog

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- Cross-platform agent compatibility through prose-based skill invocation format
- Simple, reliable prose format that works across all agent harnesses

### Changed
- Migrated from harness-specific slash-command syntax (`/skill-name`) to agent-agnostic prose invocation format
- Ensures compatibility across Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and other agent harnesses

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **Strengthened `created_at` timestamp writing in step 31** — Added explicit step-by-step instructions to ensure timestamp is consistently written
  - Broke down step 31 into explicit substeps: (a) read current design.md, (b) extract data, (c) write frontmatter with Edit tool, (d) verify formatting, (e) verify write succeeded, (f) handle missing data
  - Added clear instructions for when frontmatter exists vs. needs to be created fresh
  - Mandates using Edit tool with explicit before/after states
  - Includes retry logic and error handling if write fails
  - Rationale: Previous instructions showed what to write but didn't mandate how to write it, leading to inconsistent timestamp creation. Explicit tool instructions ensure `created_at` is written every time.
- **Added prohibition against skipping `created_at`** — Enhanced NEVER Do section to explicitly forbid proceeding without timestamp
  - Added rule: "NEVER skip writing the `created_at` timestamp — This field is required by both accelint-qrspi-apply and accelint-qrspi-archive"
  - Clarifies that missing `created_at` breaks downstream timestamp tracking (started_at, completed_at)
  - Rationale: Makes it clear this is a required field that must be written, not an optional convenience

### Version
- Bumped from 1.8.0 → 1.8.1

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- **Enhanced `--verbose` audit trail** — Renamed `q-and-a.md` to `trace.md` and expanded content to include initial input
  - File renamed: `openspec/changes/<change-name>/q-and-a.md` → `openspec/changes/<change-name>/trace.md`
  - Added initial input capture: Step 1 now stores the original ticket/feature/idea text (after flag removal) for inclusion in trace file
  - Expanded trace structure: Now contains Initial Input section (new), Research Questions section, and Research Answers section
  - Updated document title: "Questions and Answers Audit Trail" → "QRSPI Trace Audit Trail"
  - Rationale: Closes the loop from "what was entered → what was asked → what was answered", providing complete traceability of the QRSPI flow from initial input through research to design
  - Updated help text and completion messages to reference `trace.md` instead of `q-and-a.md`
- **Added `sem impact` guidance for dependency analysis** — Research sub-agent (step 14) now includes instructions to use `sem` CLI tool when available
  - Checks for `sem` CLI availability with `which sem`
  - Uses `sem impact <token>` for deterministic dependency data when research questions mention specific code entities
  - Gathers: entity definition location, dependencies, call sites/references, transitive impact
  - Rationale: Ensures design phase has complete dependency information and won't miss references or call sites

### Version
- Bumped from 1.7.0 → 1.8.0

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **`--verbose` flag for audit trail** — Users can now pass `--verbose` to save questions and answers to `q-and-a.md`
  - Flag parsing: Step 1 now checks for `--verbose` in user input and stores the flag state
  - Q&A document creation: Step 25 (if `--verbose` was set) writes `openspec/changes/<change-name>/q-and-a.md` containing research questions from step 12 and research answers from step 16
  - File format: Markdown document with ISO 8601 timestamp, questions section, and answers section
  - Rationale: Provides traceability by capturing the raw questions and research that informed design artifacts, creating an audit trail for understanding context and decision-making
  - Completion message now mentions `q-and-a.md` when `--verbose` was used
  - Usage:
    - `/accelint-qrspi-propose <ticket text>` — No q-and-a.md created (default behavior)
    - `/accelint-qrspi-propose --verbose <ticket text>` — Creates q-and-a.md audit trail

### Changed
- **Step numbering** — All steps renumbered to maintain flat numbering scheme (no sub-numbering like 24a)
  - Previous: Steps 1-24, 25, 26-47
  - New: Steps 1-26 (added verbose flag handling), 27-48
  - Rationale: Sub-numbering (e.g., 24a) was causing agents to skip steps; flat numbering prevents this issue
  - Updated all internal cross-references throughout the skill (workflow diagram, error handling, NEVER Do section)

### Version
- Bumped from 1.6.1 → 1.7.0

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Tightened behavior-defining prose without changing workflow scope**
  - Clarified the frontmatter description while preserving the same trigger families and planning-only boundary
  - Tightened root `SKILL.md` wording around context isolation, required checkpoints, error handling, and anti-patterns
  - Normalized several severity labels in body prose from rhetorical emphasis to clearer requirement language such as `REQUIRED`, while preserving existing `CRITICAL` wording inside exact sub-agent prompts and examples
  - Updated `README.md` so implementation handoff references `/accelint-qrspi-apply <change-name>` consistently and summary prose matches the skill's current checkpoint and vertical-slicing behavior
  - Rationale: Improve scanability and reduce ambiguity in behavior-bearing prose without changing trigger coverage, workflow order, or guardrail strength

### Version
- Bumped from 1.6.0 → 1.6.1

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- **Simplified and clarified sub-agent prompts** — removed verbose multi-paragraph examples and prescriptive language, made guidance more concise
  - Questions sub-agent (step 10):
    - Removed detailed examples ("How do we handle payments?" → "The ticket mentions...")
    - Removed instruction to "walk down each branch of the problem statement tree"
    - Kept core requirement: "detailed... empirical and robust technical questions"
    - Rationale: Overly prescriptive examples can constrain agents toward specific patterns. Brief guidance lets the model use its own judgment about question depth
  - Research sub-agent (step 14):
    - Restructured multi-sentence instruction into clearer bullet format
    - Softened "100% facts only. Zero opinions. Zero suggestions." to "Facts only. No opinions. No suggestions."
    - Moved anti-pattern instructions to end: "Do NOT critique code quality, editorialize or suggest changes..."
    - Rationale: The 1.5.0 language felt heavy-handed. Same requirements, friendlier tone, better structure
  - Why: More concise, less prescriptive prompts reduce token usage and give sub-agents appropriate freedom while maintaining quality standards

### Version
- Bumped from 1.5.0 → 1.6.0

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- **Strengthened question-generation guidance** — the questions sub-agent now explicitly walks the problem tree branch-by-branch, avoids solutioning, and aims for empirically answerable technical questions rather than broad prompts
  - Rationale: The branch updates tighten the front end of QRSPI so research starts from sharper, dependency-aware questions instead of vague discovery prompts that can miss critical unknowns.
- **Raised the bar for research-answer objectivity** — the research sub-agent now requires 100% factual findings, explicitly forbids opinions/suggestions/editorializing, and calls out unanswered questions when the codebase or specs do not provide evidence
  - Rationale: QRSPI depends on a clean separation between research and design. Making the research prompt stricter reduces solution bleed and gives the later design step a more reliable factual base.
- **Refined skill prose for tighter execution behavior** — wording updates make the Questions and Research steps more explicit about what good output looks like without changing the broader workflow introduced in 1.4.0
  - Rationale: These branch-level prompt refinements are small in scope but materially improve consistency in how sub-agents interpret the planning workflow.

### Version
- Bumped from 1.4.0 → 1.5.0

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Remove phase boundaries to prevent premature stopping:** Refactored from phase-based structure to continuous numbered steps
  - Rationale: Phase headers like "### Phase 0: Preflight Checks", "### Phase 1: Questions", "### Phase 2: Research" create natural stopping points where agents might pause and check with the user mid-workflow, breaking the intended continuous execution flow
  - Changed structure from:
    - "### Phase 0: Preflight Checks" / "### Phase 1: Questions" / "### Phase 2: Research" / etc.
    - To: Single "Implementation Steps" section with instruction "Execute these steps in order without stopping between them" followed by continuous numbered steps (1-N)
  - Updated workflow diagram: "Phase" column → "Stage" column (higher-level groupings like "Questions", "Research", "Design")
  - Updated all cross-references throughout (e.g., "Phase 1" → "Questions stage", "Phase 4" → step numbers)
  - Removed all `**Steps:**` sub-headers that created additional stopping points within phases
  - Integrated checkpoint instructions directly into the step sequence with clear conditions (e.g., "Step 26: STOP and wait for explicit user approval")
  - Why: Agents tend to treat phase headers and "Steps:" sub-headers as checkpoint boundaries even when not intended. Continuous numbered steps with explicit STOP instructions only at mandatory checkpoints signal where the workflow should pause vs. continue atomically

### Version
- Bumped from 1.3.0 → 1.4.0

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Frontmatter capture for specs_touched and decisions** — Phase 4 now captures structured metadata in design.md YAML frontmatter after user approval
  - Runs only after design.md is approved (checkpoint 1a) or manual edits are confirmed (checkpoint 1c), never before
  - Captures `specs_touched`: capability names declared in design.md/proposal.md as affected or introduced
  - Captures `decisions`: design.md's decision content restructured as list of `{id, choice, rationale, alternatives}` entries
  - Written to design.md YAML frontmatter (or merged if frontmatter block already exists)
  - Rationale: `accelint-qrspi-archive` needs this structured metadata for cross-capability linking. Capturing it at approval time (not earlier) ensures it reflects the final approved design, not a draft that might be edited during the checkpoint.
  - If `specs_touched` or decisions can't be confidently read from approved design.md/proposal.md, asks user to add them rather than guessing
  - Does not block Phase 5 — changes can proceed to specs/tasks without this frontmatter, though archive workflow will need to derive it later

### Changed
- **Phase 4 checkpoint expanded to 5 steps** — added frontmatter capture as step 4, before proceeding to Phase 5
  - Previous flow: approve → proceed to Phase 5
  - New flow: approve → capture frontmatter → proceed to Phase 5
  - Rationale: Frontmatter capture happens after approval but before continuing, ensuring design.md is complete for downstream workflows
- **Phase 2: Research now includes existing specs** — research sub-agent now scans `openspec/specs/INDEX.md` for relevant capabilities and reads their specs
  - Sub-agent observes what current specs say alongside what the codebase does
  - Includes spec requirements and scenarios directly in research findings, not just references
  - Rationale: Research should be objective about *both* current implementation *and* current specs of record. Without reading specs, research would miss documented requirements that haven't been implemented yet or have drifted.
- **Workflow diagram updated** — added frontmatter capture notation at Checkpoint 1: "(frontmatter capture: specs_touched/decisions -> design.md)"
- **Updated NEVER Do section** — added two new anti-patterns:
  - NEVER capture specs_touched/decisions frontmatter before design.md is in its final, approved state
  - NEVER guess specs_touched or decisions when they can't be confidently read from approved design.md/proposal.md
- **Error Handling section expanded** — added guidance for missing specs_touched/decisions in approved design.md

### Fixed
- **Frontmatter capture timing** — design.md frontmatter is now only captured *after* user approval/confirmation, not during draft/edit cycles
  - Issue: Capturing frontmatter speculatively before approval could write metadata against content the user is about to change
  - Fix: Step 4 of Phase 4 explicitly runs only after approval (1a) or confirmed edits (1c)
  - Impact: `accelint-qrspi-archive` now receives frontmatter that's guaranteed to reflect the final approved design

### Version
- Bumped from 1.2.1 → 1.3.0

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Input validation in Phase 0** — skill now checks if user provided a ticket or idea before proceeding
  - Issue: When invoked with no arguments/content, skill attempted to use internal examples to generate artifacts
  - Fix: Added validation step in Phase 0 that checks for user-provided input and exits with helpful prompt if missing
  - Rationale: Prevents skill from hallucinating requirements or using unrelated example data
  - User experience: Clear error message explaining what input is needed (ticket ID, feature request, or problem statement)

### Version
- Bumped from 1.2.0 → 1.2.1

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Agents bypassing /opsx commands** — Added explicit CRITICAL/IMPORTANT notes to prevent agents from generating artifacts directly
  - Issue: Sub-agents were sometimes writing tasks.md, proposal.md, or design.md content themselves instead of delegating to /opsx:continue commands
  - Impact: When agents generate artifacts directly, they bypass OpenSpec's configured rules and create inconsistent outputs (e.g., tasks.md missing checklist format)
  - Fix: Added CRITICAL blocks in Phase 3 and Phase 5 prompts stating "DO NOT generate content yourself. The /opsx:continue command handles artifact generation."
  - Rationale: /opsx commands follow project-specific rules in config.yaml; direct generation ignores these rules

- **CRITICAL: Markdown checklist format enforcement** — Added explicit validation for `- [ ] task` format in tasks.md
  - Issue: When restructuring tasks.md from horizontal to vertical slicing, agents might lose the markdown checklist format and use numbered lists or plain bullets
  - Impact: qrspi-apply skill depends on `- [ ] ...` format to track task completion; other formats break the workflow
  - Fix: Added CRITICAL note in Step 10b requiring markdown checklist format preservation during restructuring
  - Added anti-pattern: "NEVER use numbered lists or plain bullets in tasks.md"

- **CRITICAL: Agents skipping mandatory checkpoints** — Strengthened enforcement of Phase 4 and Phase 5 checkpoints
  - Issue: Agents were sometimes not pausing after design.md generation and proceeding directly to specs/tasks, bypassing the design review checkpoint
  - Impact: Defeats the "brain surgery" moment where design corrections are cheap; skipping review means fixing issues after code is written (expensive)
  - Fix: Added multiple CRITICAL blocks enforcing stops:
    - Phase 3 sub-agent prompt: "STOP AFTER GENERATING DESIGN.MD. Your job ends here."
    - Phase 3 Step 8: "DO NOT continue to Phase 5 yet. You MUST proceed to Phase 4 checkpoint."
    - Phase 4 header: "You MUST pause here and wait for user input."
    - Phase 4 end: "DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 5 WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL."
    - Phase 5 Step 12: "DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 6 WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL."
  - Updated workflow diagram with visual ⚠️ checkpoint markers
  - Added anti-pattern: "NEVER skip the mandatory checkpoints"

- **Parallelization Strategy overcomplicated** — Simplified guidance with concrete template and "DO NOT overcomplicate" warning
  - Issue: Agents were sometimes generating overly detailed parallelization sections with excessive edge cases
  - Fix: Added simple template format showing the right level of detail: dependencies, parallel opportunities, recommended order
  - Added explicit checkpoint (Step 9) to verify Parallelization Strategy exists and follows the simple format
  - Example template now matches the format from actual working changes

### Added
- **NEVER Do This section** — Added anti-pattern list reinforcing key principles
  - NEVER generate artifacts yourself (always use /opsx commands)
  - NEVER write tasks.md content directly (breaks checklist format)
  - NEVER overcomplicate Parallelization Strategy (keep it simple)
  - NEVER continue to specs/tasks without design approval (skips "brain surgery" checkpoint)
  - NEVER let ticket leak into research/design context (causes solution-first thinking)
  - Rationale: Explicit anti-patterns help agents avoid common failure modes

### Changed
- **Phase 5 vertical slicing guidance** — Moved detailed vertical slicing guidance from sub-agent prompt to validation step
  - Issue: Long guidance in sub-agent prompt wasn't preventing agents from generating artifacts directly, and removing it entirely lost important context for validation
  - Fix: Added brief CRITICAL notes in sub-agent prompt delegating to /opsx:continue; restored full vertical slicing guidance to Step 8 (validation phase)
  - Rationale: Validation step needs detailed criteria to restructure horizontal slices; sub-agent prompt just needs to delegate to /opsx:continue
  - Validation logic (Steps 8-10) now includes comprehensive examples and requirements for restructuring

### Version
- Bumped from 1.1.0 → 1.2.0

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Change name tracking across phases** — sub-agents now explicitly pass change name to all `/opsx:continue` calls
  - Issue: When multiple specs exist in openspec/ folder, `/opsx:continue` without a change name parameter would incorrectly target the wrong spec
  - Fix: Phase 3 now instructs sub-agent to capture and report the change name after `/opsx:new`; Phase 5 sub-agent receives this name and uses `/opsx:continue <change-name>` for all artifact generation
  - Impact: Prevents cross-contamination when working on multiple specs; ensures all artifacts are generated for the correct change
  - Completion message now includes the change name for user reference when running `/opsx:apply <change-name>`

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Phase 3 flow control** — explicitly prevent generating specs/tasks during design phase
  - Issue: Sub-agent was instructed to run `/opsx:continue` multiple times in sequence, generating proposal.md, design.md, specs/*, and tasks.md all at once
  - Fix: Added explicit STOP instruction after design.md generation; specs and tasks now generated only in Phase 5 after human design review
  - Rationale: Design checkpoint is the "brain surgery" moment — must review design before generating implementation artifacts

- **Vertical slicing guidance clarity** — strengthened instructions with concrete examples and explicit anti-patterns
  - Issue: Generated tasks.md still used horizontal (layer-by-layer) slicing despite guidance
  - Fix: Added side-by-side ✓/✗ examples, explicit "Deliverable:" requirement, and detailed indicators for detecting horizontal vs vertical structure
  - Reference: Real vertical example at `/Users/bryankizer/Documents/auditkit-cli/openspec/changes/remove-security-ruleset/tasks.md`
  - Improvement: Each slice now explicitly requires a testable end-to-end deliverable with verification steps

### Changed
- **Workflow overview diagram** — clarified that design phase outputs proposal.md + design.md only, with explicit [STOP HERE] marker
  - Rationale: Visual reinforcement of the two-phase artifact generation (design artifacts → review → task artifacts)

### Added
- **Parallelization Strategy section** — tasks.md now includes explicit section mapping dependencies and parallel opportunities
  - Content: Which slices must complete first, which can run in parallel, why they're independent, final integration steps
  - Rationale: Makes execution strategy explicit for developers/agents implementing the change

### Changed
- **Removed manual checkpoint for vertical slice conversion** — skill now ALWAYS automatically converts horizontal slicing to vertical slicing
  - Rationale: Vertical slicing is always the correct approach per QRSPI methodology; asking users to choose adds friction without value
  - Improvement: User experience is now smoother — one less decision point in the workflow

- **Added parallelization consideration to vertical slicing logic** — slices structured to be independent enough for concurrent implementation
  - Rationale: Properly structured vertical slices can be implemented by parallel agents/sub-agents, improving development velocity
  - Improvement: Tasks are now explicitly designed with parallelization in mind

### Version
- Bumped from 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
