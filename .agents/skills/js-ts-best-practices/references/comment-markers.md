- `FIXME:` - Known bugs or critical defects
- `HACK:` - Workarounds or sub-optimal solutions
- `NOTE:` - Important informational points
- `REVIEW:` - Areas requiring code review or scrutiny
- `PERF:` - Performance bottlenecks or optimizations
- `DEBUG:` - Temporary debugging code (remove later)
- `REMARK:` - General observations
