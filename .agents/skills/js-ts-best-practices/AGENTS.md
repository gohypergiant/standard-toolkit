# JavaScript and TypeScript Best Practices

> **Note:**
> This document is mainly for agents and LLMs to follow when maintaining, generating, or refactoring JavaScript or TypeScript code at Accelint. Humans may also find it useful, but guidance here is optimized for automation and consistency by AI-assisted workflows.

---

## Abstract

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for JavaScript or TypeScript applications, designed for AI agents and LLMs. Each rule includes one-line summaries here, with links to detailed examples in the `references/` folder. Load reference files only when you need detailed implementation guidance for a specific rule.

---

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start here**: Scan the rule summaries to identify relevant optimizations
2. **Load references as needed**: Click through to detailed examples only when implementing
3. **Progressive loading**: Each reference file is self-contained with ❌/✅ examples

This structure minimizes context usage while providing complete implementation guidance when needed.

## 1. General

### 1.1 Naming Conventions
Use descriptive names; append qualifiers in descending order; prefix booleans with `is`/`has`.
[View detailed examples](references/naming-conventions.md)

### 1.2 Functions
Keep functions under 50 lines; avoid defaults; use `function` keyword for pure functions.
[View detailed examples](references/functions.md)

### 1.3 Control Flow
Prefer early returns over nested conditionals; use block style for control flow.
[View detailed examples](references/control-flow.md)

### 1.4 State Management
Use `const` over `let`; never mutate passed references; keep leaf functions pure.
[View detailed examples](references/state-management.md)

### 1.5 Return Values
Always return zero values ([], {}, 0) instead of `null` or `undefined`.
[View detailed examples](references/return-values.md)

### 1.6 Misc
Use Linux line endings; employ defensive programming; aim for zero technical debt.
[View detailed examples](references/misc.md)

## 2. TypeScript

### 2.1 Any
Avoid `any`; use `unknown` for truly unknown types or generics for flexible types.
[View detailed examples](references/any.md)

### 2.2 Enums
Avoid `enum`; use `as const` structs to prevent extra JavaScript code.
[View detailed examples](references/enums.md)

### 2.3 Type vs. Interface
Prefer `type` over `interface`; use `interface` only for declaration merging or class contracts.
[View detailed examples](references/type-vs-interface.md)

---

## 3. Safety

### 3.1 Input Validation
Always validate and sanitize external data at system boundaries with schemas.
[View detailed examples](references/input-validation.md)

### 3.2 Assertions
Use assertions to detect programmer errors; split compound assertions; include values.
[View detailed examples](references/assertions.md)

### 3.3 Error Handling
Handle all errors explicitly.
[View detailed examples](references/error-handling.md)

### 3.4 Error Messages
Make user errors empathetic and actionable; make developer errors specific with values.
[View detailed examples](references/error-messages.md)

---

## 4. Performance

Design for performance from the start. Optimize slowest resources first: `network >> disk >> memory >> cpu`

### 4.1 Reduce Branching
Use table lookups instead of conditionals for static values.
[View detailed examples](references/reduce-branching.md)

### 4.2 Reduce Looping
Use `reduce` instead of chained array methods; use `Set.has()` over `Array.includes()`.
[View detailed examples](references/reduce-looping.md)

### 4.3 Memoization
Use only when appropriate; avoid memoizing trivial computations.
[View detailed examples](references/memoization.md)

### 4.4 Batching
Batch operations to amortize costly processes, especially for I/O-bound operations.
[View detailed examples](references/batching.md)

### 4.5 Predictable Execution and Cache Locality
Write code with clear execution paths; use sequential memory access; group related data.
[View detailed examples](references/predictable-execution.md)

### 4.6 Bounded Iteration
Set limits on all loops, queues, and data structures.
[View detailed examples](references/bounded-iteration.md)

### 4.7 Defer Await
Move `await` into branches where they're actually used to avoid blocking.
[View detailed examples](references/defer-await.md)

### 4.8 Cache Property Access and Variable Aliases
Cache property lookups; eliminate single-use aliases; avoid unnecessary destructuring.
[View detailed examples](references/cache-property-access.md)

### 4.9 Cache Storage API Calls
Cache `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `document.cookie` reads in memory.
[View detailed examples](references/cache-storage-api.md)

### 4.10 Object Operations
Mutate when safe; use shallow clones when needed; preallocate object shapes.
[View detailed examples](references/object-operations.md)

### 4.11 Additional Performance Concerns
Batch string operations; compile regex once; avoid async overhead; minimize closure scope.
[View detailed examples](references/performance-misc.md)

## 5. Documentation

### 5.1 JSDoc
All code needs JSDoc; exports require full documentation; internal code may use reduced tags.
[View detailed examples](references/jsdoc.md)

### 5.2 Comment Markers
Use markers (TODO, FIXME, HACK, NOTE, REVIEW, PERF, DEBUG, REMARK) for non-docblock comments.
[View detailed examples](references/comment-markers.md)

### 5.3 Comments to Remove
Remove commented-out code, edit history, and comments restating obvious code.
[View detailed examples](references/comments-to-remove.md)

### 5.4 Comments to Preserve
Preserve markers, linter directives, business logic explanations, and docblocks.
[View detailed examples](references/comments-to-preserve.md)

### 5.5 Comments Placement
Move end-of-line comments to their own line above the code.
[View detailed examples](references/comments-placement.md)
