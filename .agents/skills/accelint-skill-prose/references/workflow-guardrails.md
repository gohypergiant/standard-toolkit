# Workflow and guardrail safety

Use this reference when editing skill prose that controls execution order, approvals, safety rules, or exact technical references.

## Treat workflow prose as executable guidance

When the user is editing a skill folder, do not assess a workflow passage in isolation if other files finish the workflow contract. Treat the folder as one behavior contract distributed across an artifact set. Default to the root `SKILL.md`, sibling `AGENTS.md` if present, and relevant behavior-bearing `references/*.md`, then add other linked instruction files as needed. Read the root `SKILL.md`, then follow explicit links and references from `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and other instruction files before you broaden to the relevant behavior-bearing support files so you preserve cross-file order, gates, and exact references.

If discovery is inconclusive, retry with a simpler listing method or direct directory inspection. Do not treat an incomplete crawl as evidence that no linked support files exist.

Ask:

- If an agent followed only the rewritten text, would it behave the same way?
- Did the rewrite preserve order, gates, conditions, and rationale?
- Did you check whether any artifact-set file required changes for behavioral consistency, without forcing edits where preservation is safer?
- Did you judge each behavior-bearing file on its own local clarity, but only after behavior preservation and concrete consistency checks passed?

## Preserve exactly when important

Keep these exact unless the user explicitly asks otherwise:

- step numbers
- before/after timing
- approval checkpoints
- file names and paths
- commands and flags
- field names and keys
- slash-joined references such as `specs_touched/decisions`
- examples that anchor the rule
- linked support-file wording that completes the workflow contract
- behavior-bearing verbs such as `stop`, `pause`, `wait`, `proceed`, `skip`, `require`, and `allow`
- rationale sentences that explain why a guardrail exists or what risk it prevents

## Common failure modes

### Order drift

- moving a step earlier because it sounds cleaner
- merging two steps that carry different decisions
- dropping `not before` or similar timing boundaries

### Guardrail weakening

- `must` becomes `should`
- `do not` becomes `avoid`
- `critical` becomes ordinary emphasis

### Specificity loss

- replacing a named token with a broader category
- replacing an example with generic prose
- replacing exact rationale with a vague safety summary
- replacing a behavior-bearing verb with a near-synonym that changes permission, timing, or obligation strength
- preserving qualitative gate wording that still lets the model self-justify a fallback, exception, or looser path
- replacing one qualitative branch term with another and treating that rewrite as resolved

## Safe moves

- split a long sentence while keeping the same sequence
- move the condition before the command when the timing stays the same
- cut filler that does not change why the rule exists
- preserve exact tokens inline while tightening surrounding prose
- keep source rationale sentences, and tighten them only by removing non-behavioral filler
- do not add new justifications, consequences, or evaluative language

## Verb-sensitivity quick check

Before you deliver, ask:

- Did `stop`, `wait`, `skip`, `proceed`, or similar verbs change to a softer or different action?
- Did a requirement verb like `must` become advice like `should`?
- Did any qualitative cue such as `practical`, `impractical`, `reasonable`, `beneficial`, `small`, or `if needed` remain as a hidden permission slip?
- Did you merely swap one qualitative branch term for another?
- Would the rewritten version let the agent act earlier, later, or more optionally than before?

## Delivery rule

If exactness and tightening conflict, preserve exactness.
If the safest result is a minimal rewrite, keep it minimal.
If any rewrite still feels risky, recommend no rewrite or deliver an audit only.
