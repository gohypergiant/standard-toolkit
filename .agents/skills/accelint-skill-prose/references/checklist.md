# Skill prose checklist

Run this checklist before you deliver an audit or rewrite.

## 1. Trigger safety

- Would the rewritten description still trigger for the same requests?
- Did any scope-defining phrase disappear?
- Did any new trigger family appear without an explicit request?
- Did a short description turn into a broader trigger inventory?

## 2. Workflow safety

- Would an agent following only the rewrite behave the same way?
- Did any step move earlier or later?
- Did any approval gate, timing rule, or condition become less clear?
- If the source included a reason the step matters, did the rewrite preserve it without adding a new reason?
- Did any behavior-bearing verb change meaning, such as `stop` → `pause`, `wait` → `delay`, or `must` → `should`?
- Did I invent any qualifier, exception, threshold, fallback case, or environmental assumption?
- Did any qualitative wording remain even though it still acts as a hidden gate, fallback case, exception, or permission slip?
- Did I add any source-unsupported rationale, failure mode, or benefit claim?
- Did I create a stronger gate or branch than the source explicitly stated?
- Did any numbered step become a stage note, transition-only filler, or numbering placeholder?
- Is the first real operation still easy to find?
- If the document already had stages or phases, did the rewrite preserve that organizing mechanic or explicitly justify changing it?

## 3. Guardrail strength

- Did any `must`, `do not`, `never`, `required`, or `critical` wording get softer?
- Did any prohibition become advice?
- Did any safety caveat disappear?
- Did I infer a requirement level from emphasis language alone?

## 4. Exact-reference safety

Check that these stayed exact unless the user asked otherwise:

- file paths
- commands and flags
- field names and keys
- identifiers
- slash-joined references
- inline code and code blocks
- quoted errors and logs
- cross-reference filenames and section labels
- exact verbs when verb choice defines behavior, permission, or timing

## 5. Vocabulary and synonym control

- Did you pick one term for each repeated concept and keep it?
- Did any accidental synonym drift appear after editing?
- Are scope-defining verbs still the same ones the source used where that distinction matters?
- Did you audit qualitative terms such as `small`, `complex`, `practical`, `impractical`, `beneficial`, `significant`, `materially`, `if needed`, `when appropriate`, or `without reason` for hidden branching behavior?
- Did you avoid treating one qualitative branch term as a sufficient fix for another?

## 6. Audit severity calibration

- If you used severity labels, do they match real behavior risk rather than rhetorical emphasis?
- Is `Critical` reserved for issues likely to change trigger routing, workflow behavior, approval handling, or safety boundaries?
- Would a calmer label still communicate the same risk just as well?

## 7. Clarity and tightening

- Is the rewrite clearer, not just shorter?
- Did you state the rule, action, boundary, or decision early enough?
- Did you remove filler without removing behavior?
- Did you split overloaded sentences without changing order?
- Did you separate instruction from explanation when that made the behavior easier to follow?
- Did you keep one term for one concept across the edited files?
- Did you keep examples that define scope?
- Did you preserve rationale sentences that explain a guardrail, checkpoint, or timing rule?
- If the user asked for a note, checklist, banner, or other compact format, did you preserve that format instead of expanding it into procedure or policy prose?

## 8. Cross-file consistency

- If the task covered a skill folder, did you define the default artifact set clearly: root `SKILL.md`, sibling `AGENTS.md` if present, relevant behavior-bearing `references/*.md`, and any other linked instruction files needed to preserve the contract?
- Did you read the root `SKILL.md` first?
- After that, did you follow explicit links and references from `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and other inspected instruction files before broadening to the rest of the behavior-bearing file set?
- Did you audit the full behavior-bearing artifact set rather than only the quoted excerpt, and were those files eligible for edit when consistency required it?
- Did you rewrite any artifact-set files that needed updates so terminology, severity language, workflow wording, examples, and progressive-disclosure handoffs stayed aligned?
- Did you also check local sentence-structure quality in each behavior-bearing file, rather than treating cross-file alignment as the only rewrite criterion?
- If any behavior-bearing file stayed unchanged, can you explain why it did not need an edit, including why its local prose was already near the minimum safe form?
- If discovery was inconclusive, did you retry with a simpler listing method or direct directory inspection instead of treating the crawl as complete?
- Did you preserve consistency between the root instructions and the linked files that complete the workflow or examples?

## 9. Output-mode compliance

- Did you keep output mode separate from rewrite mode?
- If the request was audit-only, did you avoid rewriting the full passage?
- If the request was rewrite-only, did you avoid prepending audit notes?
- If the rewrite used `mode=default`, did you keep the structure local unless the structure itself hid behavior?
- If the rewrite used `mode=strict`, did you reorganize only as far as needed to clarify behavior?
- If the rewrite changed stage boundaries, checkpoint placement, numbering architecture, or overview/checklist alignment, did you classify it as structural instead of presenting it as local cleanup?
- If the safest result was no rewrite, did you say so explicitly instead of forcing a cosmetic edit?

## 10. Final question

- Is this behaviorally safer than an ordinary prose edit?
- If risk remains, should you revise less or recommend no rewrite?
