# Serial-instruction guidance for behavior-defining prose

Use this reference when a skill, prompt, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, workflow note, or guardrail text contains ordered actions, implied sequence, approval timing, validation loops, or branch logic.

## Why this matters here

In behavior-defining prose, sequence is part of the contract.

If the source says an agent must ask first, wait for approval, load references before rewriting, validate before delivery, or return to an earlier step after a failed check, that order is behavior-bearing. A rewrite that makes the prose cleaner but less ordered is a behavior change.

## Detection pass

Run this pass before you edit workflow-bearing prose.

### 1. Detect explicit serial instructions
Look for:
- numbered lists
- `Step 1`, `Stage 2`, `First`, `Next`, `Then`, `After`, `Finally`
- `before`, `after`, `until`, `once`, `when`, `only then`
- `requires`, `depends on`, `done when`
- `if this fails, return to`
- `do not proceed until`
- approval gates such as `ask first`, `wait for confirmation`, `pause`, `stop`, or `resume`

### 2. Detect implied step ordering
Look for:
- one sentence that contains two or more actions joined by `and`, `then`, or commas
- paragraphs that mix discovery, decision, rewrite, and verification in one block
- warnings that imply a missing gate
- references that must be loaded before a later action is safe
- statements where one action clearly uses the result of an earlier action

### 3. Detect sequencing cues in skill files
Look for:
- output-mode selection before delivery rules
- rewrite-mode selection before rewriting
- artifact discovery before cross-file edits
- reference-loading conditions before rule citation
- self-check requirements before delivery
- approval rules before edits that would broaden scope or change structure

### 4. Detect sequencing cues in general prose
Look for:
- procedural guidance hidden inside paragraphs
- policy or workflow notes that bury a timing rule inside rationale
- branches written as straight lists
- bullets that are really ordered tasks
- banner warnings that try to enforce order without a gate

## Preferred structures

Choose the smallest structure that preserves behavior and makes the order hard to miss.

### Step 1: Classify the workflow units
Before you restructure workflow prose, classify each unit as an action, gate, readiness check, stage note, branch handler, or landmark checkpoint. Do not give all six categories the same structural weight.
Done when: you know which units need ordered steps, which units stay at stage level, and which units act as gates or checks.

### Step 2: Choose the base structure by workflow length
Requires: Step 1 is complete.

#### 2 to 3 short ordered steps
Use a numbered list.

#### 4 or more ordered steps
Use this pattern by default:

### Step 0: Track progress
Use a checklist or task-tracking step before the workflow.

Then use:
- `### Step N: Name`
- `Requires:` for dependencies
- `Done when:` for gates that later steps rely on
- an explicit failure route such as `If this check fails, return to Step 3.`
Done when: the reader can see the order, state, dependencies, and retry path without inferring them.

### Step 3: Keep stage structure when the workflow already has it
Requires: Step 2 is complete.
If you need a higher-level container above ordered steps, prefer `## Stage:` or a descriptive section heading. Ordered steps still need their own numbered step headings inside that container.

If the document already names stages or phases in more than one place, treat that as evidence of an existing organizing mechanic rather than flattening everything into peer numbered steps.
Put phase purpose, context isolation, rationale, and entry conditions at stage level unless they need a standalone numbered checkpoint.
Done when: stage notes stay as stage notes and step headings only carry operational work.

### Step 4: Name every branch and rejoin point
Requires: Step 3 is complete.
Name each branch and the join point.

Good pattern:
- `If X, go to Step 4a.`
- `If not X, go to Step 4b.`
- `Both branches return to Step 5.`
Done when: every branch names its destination and its rejoin point.

## Rewrite rules

Apply these rules in order when you rewrite serial instructions.

1. Treat one step as one action. Split any step that says `and then`.
2. Do not use empty step headings. Every `### Step N: Name` block must contain at least one operational sentence, gate, or completion condition.
3. Do not create a numbered step if it only restates stage purpose, repeats a nearby context rule, announces the next phase, or preserves numbering without operational value.
4. If a step heading only labels a principle, convert that principle into an action the agent or reader can execute, or demote it to a stage note.
5. Never leave ordered work in plain bullets. Replace plain bullets with ordered steps when the work is not actually optional or unordered.
6. Move conditions before actions when that makes timing clearer without changing behavior, using only source-stated conditions.
7. Replace emphasis-only warnings with enforceable gates only when the source already states that dependency explicitly elsewhere. Do not create new gates from inferred intent alone.
8. Keep approval, validation, and retry logic explicit.
9. Keep sequencing cues in the operational file. Move heuristics, examples, and edge cases to references.
10. If the source explicitly establishes sequence but states it weakly, clarify that sequence without adding new steps, rationale, constraints, or qualitative judgments. If sequence is only inferred rather than explicit, flag the ambiguity in audit mode or ask before strengthening it.
11. Preserve landmark step numbers when they are reused across the file or tied to checkpoints, but do not pad the workflow with weak filler steps only to keep numbering contiguous.
12. Treat a rewrite as structural when it changes stage boundaries, numbering architecture, checkpoint placement, or overview/checklist alignment.
13. A transition step is acceptable only when it enforces a real prohibition, readiness boundary, or handoff state that later steps depend on.

## Audit questions

Ask these before you finalize the edit:
1. Could an agent now do these steps out of order and still claim compliance?
2. Did any `ask first`, `wait`, `pause`, `stop`, `return`, or `do not proceed until` rule become softer?
3. Did any step heading stay empty or act only as decoration instead of instruction?
4. Did a paragraph still hide multiple actions that should be separate steps?
5. Did any branch lose its named destination or rejoin point?
6. Did any validation or approval rule stay as emphasis instead of becoming a gate?
7. Did I create any numbered steps that are really stage notes, transition-only fillers, or numbering placeholders?
8. Is the first real operation still easy to find?
9. Would a stage container be safer than more peer numbered steps?
10. If the rewrite changed stage boundaries, numbering, or checkpoints, did I surface it as structural?
11. Would an agent reading only the rewritten text still follow the same order under load?

## Notes for this skill

Load this reference whenever workflow order, approval semantics, guardrail timing, reference-loading order, or validation loops are central to the edit.

For small local edits, keep the main file compact. For heavier sequencing logic, keep the main `SKILL.md` operational and use this reference for the detection pass, structure rules, and edge cases.
