# Skill prose examples

Use these examples when you need a concrete model for what safe editing looks like.

## 1. Audit-only vs audit-plus-rewrite

### Audit-only

**Request:** Audit this workflow note for ambiguity. Do not rewrite it.

**Source:**
> If the design looks mostly okay, you can skip the detailed review unless there are obvious red flags.

**Good response shape:**

- Summary of risk
- Findings with source text, risk, and why it matters
- No full rewritten passage

**Why this is correct:**
The user asked for audit-only output. Giving a rewritten passage would violate mode selection even if the rewrite were safer.

### Audit plus rewrite

**Request:** Audit this workflow note, then give me a safer rewrite.

**Safe response pattern:**

1. Summary of risk
2. Findings
3. Rewritten passage

**Why this is correct:**
The user explicitly asked for both outputs, so the rewrite is part of the requested deliverable rather than a stealth mode shift.

## 2. No-rewrite decision

**Request:** Tighten this instruction if possible: `Load references/workflow-steps.md before Step 5.`

**Good answer:**
> No rewrite recommended. The instruction is already compact, exact, and behaviorally clear. Any shorter rewrite would either change timing or lose the exact path.

**Why this is correct:**
The safest move is to preserve a sentence that is already minimal, exact, and unambiguous.

## 3. Preserve hard-stop strength

**Before:**
> NEVER change the user's meaning to make a sentence shorter. Precision outranks brevity.

**Safe rewrite:**
> Never change the user's meaning for brevity. Precision outranks brevity.

**Unsafe rewrite:**
> Avoid changing the user's meaning just to make the sentence shorter.

**Why the unsafe version drifts:**
`Avoid` is weaker than `Never`. The rewrite changes a prohibition into advice.

## 4. Preserve behavior-bearing verbs

**Before:**
> NEVER stop between living document updates and verification waiting for user confirmation.

**Safer rewrite:**
> Never stop between living document updates and verification to wait for user confirmation.

**Unsafe rewrite:**
> Never pause between living document updates and verification for user confirmation.

**Why the unsafe version drifts:**
`Pause` is close to `stop`, but it is not always equivalent in workflow prose. The original verb may define when execution is forbidden to halt.

## 5. Preserve trigger-family coverage in descriptions

**Before:**
> Use when users say 'create a skill', 'audit this skill', 'improve this skill', or when creating, refactoring, or auditing domain expertise into agent skills.

**Safe rewrite:**
> Use when users want to create, audit, or improve a skill, or when turning domain expertise into agent skills.

**Unsafe rewrite:**
> Use when users need skill help.

**Why the unsafe version drifts:**
It collapses distinct trigger families into a vague bucket and weakens the description's trigger logic.

## 6. Cross-file consistency when editing a skill

**Request:** Tighten this skill's prose safely. The user pasted only one section, but the skill also has `AGENTS.md` and `references/` files.

**Good response pattern:**

1. Define the artifact set: root `SKILL.md`, sibling `AGENTS.md` if present, and the behavior-bearing `references/` files that complete the contract
2. Read the root `SKILL.md`
3. Load the behavior-bearing support files that carry workflow rules, examples, trigger guidance, or exact wording constraints, including relevant `references/` files
4. Edit the minimum set of artifact-set files needed to keep wording consistent across the skill folder
5. Be ready to explain why any behavior-bearing file stayed unchanged

**Why this is correct:**
A local rewrite can create drift if linked files still use older terms, weaker severity language, contradictory examples, or stale progressive-disclosure handoffs.

## 7. Preserve short-note format

**Request:** Make this onboarding note easier to scan. Return only the revised note.

**Source:**
> VPN access happens after device setup.

**Safe rewrite:**
> VPN access happens after device setup.

**Also safe if the user explicitly asked for scanability help and the emphasis cue adds no meaning, process detail, or policy force:**
> **VPN access happens after device setup.**

**Unsafe rewrite:**
> Complete device setup first. VPN access is provisioned after your device is configured, and you will not receive credentials until IT confirms setup is complete.

**Why the unsafe version drifts:**
It escalates a simple note into more procedural, policy-like instruction and adds process detail the source did not require.

## 8. Preserve rationale when it carries policy

**Before:**
> Frontmatter capture happens at step 30 after Checkpoint 1 approval, not before, because earlier capture can write frontmatter against content the user is about to change.

**Safe rewrite:**
> Capture frontmatter at step 30 after Checkpoint 1 approval, not before. Earlier capture can bind frontmatter to content the user is about to change.

**Unsafe rewrite:**
> Capture frontmatter at step 30 after Checkpoint 1 approval.

**Why the unsafe version drifts:**
It drops the rationale that explains what risk the timing rule prevents. That reason is part of the operational meaning.

## 9. Positive rewrite method for guardrails

**Before:**
> Never weaken approval gates during cleanup.

**Safer rewrite:**
> Do not weaken approval gates during cleanup. Approval gates control when work may proceed.

**Why this is useful:**
The rewrite keeps the prohibition, then may restate the protected behavior only when that behavior is already explicit in the source or directly entailed by nearby source text. It must not add new rationale, diagnoses, or qualitative judgments.

## 10. Positive rewrite method for workflow prose

**Before:**
> If the support files appear relevant, review them before revising the root file.

**Safer rewrite:**
> Before you revise the root file, review the support files that complete the workflow contract.

**Why this is useful:**
The rewrite leads with timing and action, keeps the dependency explicit, and makes the operational sequence easier to scan without changing behavior.

## 11. Local rewrite versus structural rewrite

**Local rewrite (`mode=default`):**
> Preserve the checklist format. Tighten each item without changing order.

**Structural rewrite (`mode=strict`):**
> Preserve the checklist logic, but group the items into trigger safety, workflow safety, and exact-reference safety if the current order hides the control points.

**Why this distinction matters:**
Default mode keeps the structure local. Strict mode allows reorganization only when the structure itself is the clarity problem.

## 12. Remove qualitative fallback cues when they steer execution

**Before:**
> For small repos or constrained environments, use focused inline discovery instead of forcing a brittle parallel workflow.

**Intermediate but still unsafe rewrite:**
> When subagents are unavailable or impractical in the current execution context, use focused inline discovery instead.

**Why this is still unsafe:**
`Impractical` is still a qualitative branch term. It leaves discretionary room for the model to self-justify the fallback.

**Safer rewrite:**
> When subagents are unavailable, use focused inline discovery instead.

**Why this is safer:**
The source sentence uses qualitative cues such as `small`, `constrained`, and `brittle` to steer a fallback branch. Replacing them with `impractical` still leaves the branch under-specified. The safer rewrite keeps the fallback and removes the qualitative gate.

**Audit finding pattern:**
> The fallback condition is under-specified. Qualitative wording such as `small repos`, `constrained environments`, `brittle`, or `impractical` can act as a hidden permission slip. Tighten the branch condition or flag it as unresolved policy ambiguity.
