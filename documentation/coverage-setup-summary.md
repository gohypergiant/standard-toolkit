# Coverage Reporting Setup - Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully configured automated test coverage reporting for pull requests in the standard-toolkit monorepo.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

1. **`.github/workflows/coverage-comment.yml`**
   - GitHub Actions workflow that runs on PR events (opened, synchronize, reopened)
   - Generates coverage for both PR branch and base branch
   - Compares coverage and posts a comment with the delta
   - Updates existing comment if one already exists (avoids comment spam)

2. **`documentation/coverage.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation about coverage reporting
   - Explains how the system works for developers
   - Provides tips and best practices
   - Documents that enforcement is not enabled (yet)

### Modified Files

1. **`tooling/vitest-config/no-dom.js`**
   - Added `json-summary` and `text` reporters to coverage config
   - These additional formats help with the merging and reporting process

2. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**
   - Added a new "Development Workflow" section
   - Includes testing guidelines
   - Links to the coverage documentation

## How It Works

### Workflow Steps

1. **PR Branch Coverage**
   - Checks out the PR branch
   - Installs dependencies and builds packages
   - Runs all tests with coverage enabled
   - Merges coverage reports from all packages using NYC

2. **Base Branch Coverage**
   - Checks out the base branch (e.g., `main`)
   - Runs the same process to get baseline coverage

3. **Generate Delta & Comment**
   - Calculates the difference between PR and base coverage
   - Posts/updates a comment on the PR with:
     - Current coverage percentages (Lines, Statements, Functions, Branches)
     - Base branch percentages
     - Delta showing the change

### Key Features

- **No Spam**: Updates existing comment instead of creating new ones
- **Monorepo-Aware**: Merges coverage from all packages using NYC
- **Non-Blocking**: Tests continue even if some fail (`continue-on-error: true`)
- **No Enforcement**: Currently informational only - doesn't fail PRs
- **Automatic**: Triggers on every PR update

## Configuration Details

### Vitest Coverage Settings

```javascript
coverage: {
  provider: 'istanbul',
  reporter: ['json', 'json-summary', 'lcov', 'text'],
  reportsDirectory: './coverage',
  enabled: true,
  clean: true,
  passWithNoTests: true,
}
```

### Workflow Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

The workflow needs `pull-requests: write` permission to post comments.

## Next Steps

1. **Test on a Real PR**: Open a test PR to see the coverage comment in action
2. **Monitor**: Watch a few PRs to ensure the workflow is stable
3. **Adjust**: Fine-tune the presentation or add more metrics if needed
4. **Future Enforcement**: Consider adding coverage thresholds once baseline is established

## Potential Enhancements

Future improvements could include:

- **Coverage Badges**: Add badges to README showing current coverage
- **Fail on Decrease**: Fail PRs that decrease coverage by more than X%
- **Per-Package Details**: Show coverage breakdown by package in the comment
- **Coverage Trends**: Track coverage over time in a dashboard
- **HTML Reports**: Generate and upload HTML coverage reports as artifacts

## Testing Locally

To test coverage generation locally:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test

# Check coverage for a specific package
cd packages/bus
ls -la coverage/

# View coverage files
cat coverage/coverage-summary.json
```

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:

1. Check the Actions tab in GitHub for error logs
2. Verify all packages have test scripts defined
3. Ensure NYC is being installed globally in the workflow
4. Check that coverage files are being generated (look for `coverage-final.json`)

## Implementation Date

October 28, 2025 - Along with vitest upgrade to v4.0.4
