# @accelint/map-toolkit

## Installation

```sh
npm install @accelint/map-toolkit
```

## Structure

- standard-toolkit/packages/map-toolkit
  - src
    - deckgl
      - [feature folders]
      - index.ts (generated by indexer)

    - [other technology folders, ex: maplibre]

    - ~~index.ts~~ (do not create a root level barrel, there should only be tech level barrels, but also support individual feature exports in package.json)

  - [misc files, ex: package.json, etc]

Similar to DesignTK, all features within a technology MUST work together, to help guarantee this we will not publish them as individual packages, but as part of a single package.

The one open question will be around how to not force unnecessary dependencies on consumers. If we choose to use optionalDependencies, instead of peerDependencies (ref: @accelint/bus/react & https://github.com/gohypergiant/standard-toolkit/blob/main/packages/bus/package.json#L57 ) it will make it more flexible (but also more challenging). Weâ€™ll need to document that this is the plan (unless another option is found) on a per feature basis so that consumers know which dependencies to install
