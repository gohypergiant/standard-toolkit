# Group Theory


<sup>[1]</sup>
A group $G$ is a finite or infinite set of elements together with a binary operation (called the group operation) that together satisfy the four fundamental properties of closure, associativity, the identity property, and the inverse property. The operation with respect to which a group is defined is often called the "group operation," and a set is said to be a group "under" this operation. Elements $A$, $B$, $C$, ... with binary operation between $A$ and $B$ denoted $AB$ form a group if:

  1. __Closure__: If $A$ and $B$ are two elements in $G$, then the product $A\:B$ is also in $G$.

  2. __Associativity__: The defined multiplication is associative, i.e., for all $A$, $B$, $C$ in $G$, $(A\:B)\:C = A\:(B\:C)$.

  3. __Identity__: There is an identity element $I$ (a.k.a. $1$, $E$, or $e$) such that $I\:A = A\:I = A$ for every element $A$ in $G$.

  4. __Inverse__: There must be an inverse (a.k.a. reciprocal) of each element. Therefore, for each element $A$ of $G$, the set contains an element $B = A^{-1}$ such that $A\:A^{-1} = A^{-1}\:A = I$.
