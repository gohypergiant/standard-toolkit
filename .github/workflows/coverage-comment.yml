# Coverage Report Workflow
#
# This workflow generates test coverage reports for pull requests and posts a comparison
# comment showing the coverage differences between the PR branch and the base branch (main).
#
# The workflow runs in two stages:
# 1. coverage-main: Generates coverage report for the base branch (main)
# 2. coverage-pr: Generates coverage report for the PR branch and posts a comparison comment
#
# The comparison shows per-package coverage changes (lines, statements, functions, branches)
# to help reviewers understand the impact of changes on test coverage.
