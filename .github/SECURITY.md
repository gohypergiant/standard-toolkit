# Security

Hypergiant takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Hypergiant-owned repository that meets the definition of a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below. The definition:

As a CVE Naming Authority (CNA), Hypergiant follows the MITRE.org definition of a security vulnerability which defines a security vulnerability as “a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or functionality in their entirety).” MITRE.org CNA Rules 7.1.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released. Please report findings to our security team at [infosec@hypergiant.com](mailto:infosec@hypergiant.com).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
