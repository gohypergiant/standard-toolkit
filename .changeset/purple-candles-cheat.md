Restructured tokens and utilities to better utilize Tailwind patterns
Exposed all colors, including primitives (without official documentation) to allow for more flexible use of color values

This change potentially allows a lot more freedom to break out of the design system, so use at your own risk

Preferred approach is to continue to use documented color utilities
