## üí° Contributing

## ‚ú® Versioning

DevTK follows [Semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning of packages to enable consumers to trust what is changing between versions.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, the meanings of each number changing follows these guidelines:

- __MAJOR__
  - Any "breaking" changes; something used to work one way - and therefor consumers might be using a package in that way and thus relying on that functionality - and in the next available version that something now works in a different way
- __MINOR__
  - Additional changes; adding functionality, enhancing/extending (without changing) existing functionality
- __PATCH__
  - Fixing problems; making something work that should have worked but don't
  - Adding documentation to better explain what is available
  - Improved testing to make the expectations more explicit and automatically tested
