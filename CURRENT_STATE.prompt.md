# Compound Components Implementation Context

## Current Status
We're implementing compound component validation in the design system using a TypeScript transformer approach. The system currently:
1. Automatically detects compound components using `@compound-component` JSDoc tags
2. Validates component structure during build time
3. Integrates with tsup build process

## Key Files
- `design-toolkit/components/tsup.config.ts`: Contains build configuration with compound component transformer
- `tooling/ts-transformer-compound-components/`: Custom TypeScript transformer implementation
- `design-toolkit/components/src/components/dialog/`: Example compound component implementation

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented automatic compound component detection in build process
2. Added JSDoc-based validation system (`@compound-component` and `@requires` tags)
3. Successfully integrated transformer with tsup build pipeline

## Last Working State
- Build is working successfully with automatic component detection
- Detected compound components include Dialog and TooltipTrigger
- Runtime validation is in place alongside build-time checks

## Next Steps To Consider
1. Add more comprehensive testing for transformer edge cases
2. Document compound component creation process for other developers
3. Consider adding validation error reporting improvements
4. Look into supporting more complex component relationships

## Technical Context
- Using TypeScript transformer API for build-time validation
- JSDoc tags for component structure definition
- Integrated with tsup build system for esbuild compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- Components are detected by scanning `src/components/*/index.tsx`
- Validation occurs during build phase
- No manual configuration needed in tsup.config.ts for new compound components

When resuming work, start by checking the current state of compound component detection by running `pnpm build` in the design-toolkit/components directory.
