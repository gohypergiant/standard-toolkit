# VICTORY Chart

__Visual Integration of Coordination, Timing, Objectives, and Responsibilities__

The VICTORY chart is a mission planning and execution support tool designed to represent complex, time-dependent activities across multiple participants and units. It facilitates a clear operational picture by aligning strategic Vision with tactical execution layers: Coordination, Timing, Objectives, and individual Responsibilities.

Each chart presents mission-critical sequences across units (personnel, vehicles, or systems), ensuring synchronized operations and alignment with strategic intent. Activities are visualized within a structured timeline, enabling planners and operators to anticipate dependencies, mitigate conflict, and confirm readiness across all phases of execution.

> The VICTORY chart supports commanders and mission planners in achieving unity of effort and operational precision.
>
> Before engagement, check your VI.<br/>
> Your VICTORY chart is the blueprint for success.

  - __VI__: Vision         (chart)
  - __C__:  Coordination   (row)
  - __T__:  Timing         (timeline)
  - __O__:  Objective      (group)
  - __RY__: Responsibility (action/event)

## Overview

This library exposes two primary components: __core__ and __standard__.

  - __core__ provides minimal structure and functionalityâ€”intended as a lightweight, flexible foundation.
  - __standard__ builds on core to demonstrate a full-featured, styled implementation. It serves as both:
      - A working default for most use cases.
      - A reference for building custom implementations atop core.

This separation enables multiple products to share functionality without being locked into a single visual design or component contract.

## Basic Use

In the simplest case only `data` is required.

```tsx
import 'server-only';

import { VictoryChart } from '@accelint/victory-chart';

async function Chart() {
  const data = await fetch('https://some.data');

  return <VictoryChart data={data} />;
}

// React Server Component
export default function Page() {
  return <Chart />;
}

// a more customized implementation
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Chart
      data={[...]}
      plugins={{
        timing
        title: false,
      }}
      />
  );
}
```

A more customized implementation would look something like this:

```tsx
import 'server-only';

import { VictoryChart } from '@accelint/victory-chart';
import { Timing } from '@components/charting/custom/timing'

async function Chart() {
  const data = await fetch('https://some.data');

  return (
    <VictoryChart
      data={data}
      plugins={{
        timing: Timing,
        title: 'Excellent Things',
      }}
      state={{ focus: 2, zoom: 200 }}
      />
  );
}

// React Server Component
export default function Page() {
  return <Chart />;
}
```

## Customization & Initialization

The chart accepts several properties to control its behavior and appearance:

__Required__

  - `data` - The data source for the chart. Supports both flat and nested (recursive) structures.

__Optional__

  - `plugins` - An object of custom React components to override specific chart elements.
  - `state` - Values used to initialize internal chart state (e.g., selected time "focus" or zoom level).
