# Tree

Tree view allows users to navigate lists of data with nested levels that can be expanded or collapsed.

It is composed of the following components:

- **Tree** - parent that drives global tree behavior like selection or drag and drop
- **Tree.Item** - defines an individual tree node item
- **Tree.Content** - composes the actual display of the tree node content. `Tree.Item` will always have `Tree.Content` composed inside it.
- **Tree.Label** - places and styles the tree node label
- **Tree.Description** - places and styles the tree description
- **Tree.PrefixIcon** - places and styles the icon that optionally shows before a tree node
- **Tree.Actions** - container for unique application icons for a tree item

## Dynamic versus Static Tree content
The `Tree` can be rendered with either static data, meaning that all of the tree items are known and will not be changing when you render the `Tree`, or with dynamic data that is from a database or other source.
