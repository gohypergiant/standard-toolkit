## Drag and Drop

To enable drag and drop, provide the following

A function that returns the items being dragged. This is required and if not

`getItems?: (keys: Set<Key>) => DragItem[]`

<Canvas of={ TreeStories.DragAndDrop } />

## Tree.Item

The `<Tree.Item>` component displays a single item in the tree.

### UseTree

This is an optional recusive component that you can use with the also optional `useTree` hook. They are designed as helpers to make tree state management and recursion simpler to work with.

### Tree.Node


## Manual management of state

You can opt out of using these helpers by using the `TreeItem` directly and recursing over your data structure with something like the following:
