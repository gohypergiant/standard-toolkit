# Tabs

Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them.

It is composed of the following components:

- **[Tabs](../?path=/docs/components-tabs-tabs--playground)** - Wrapper for the List and Panels.
- **[List](../?path=/docs/components-tabs-tabs-list--playground)** - Wrapper for the Tab components.
- **[Tab](../?path=/docs/components-tabs-tabs-tab--playground)** - Displays the Tab and makes a connection to a Panel with the same id.
- **[Panel](../?path=/docs/components-tabs-tabs-panel--playground)** - Renders content related to the selected Tab.

The `<Tabs>` component is a direct wrapper around the `Tabs` component from `react-aria-components`.

Please see the documentation for that component [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Tabs.html).

## Structure

```
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Tab />
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel />
</Tabs>
```

## Composition Requirements

Error boundaries for incorrect usage of these components:

- `Tabs` must include a `Tabs.List`
- `Tabs.List` must include at least 1 `Tabs.Tab`
