# Hotkey
This is a representation of key(s) from a keyboard that executes a specific action. Common examples of hotkeys are: Copy (CMD/Ctrl + C), Paste (CMD/Ctrl + V), Undo (CMD/Ctrl + Z), and Save (CMD/Ctrl/ + S);

## Example usage
```
<Hotkey>KEY</Hotkey>
```

## Variants

* **Flat** - renders plain text, appropriate for using in a `Menu.Item` component
* **Outline** - renders with borders.
* **Icon** - renders an icon with the right size and spacing. An icon hotkey will never have a border.

**Outline** is the default variant and should be used in most cases, unless the Hotkey is used as an element in a more complex parent, like an `Options` list.

<Canvas of={HotkeyStories.Default} />

# Hotkey Set
If you want to group a set of `Hotkey` together to show multiple keystrokes or mouse events, wrap in a `Hotkey.Set` component.

Wrapping the `+` or `or` interstitial marks in a `span` is optional.

## Example usage
```
<Hotkey.Set>
  <Hotkey variant='outline'>CMD</Hotkey>
  <span>+</span>
  <Hotkey variant='icon'>
    <Icon>
      <MouseRightClick />
    </Icon>
  </Hotkey>
</Hotkey.Set>
```

<Canvas of={HotkeyStories.KeysSet} />

## Implementation Notes
The `Hotkey` component wraps the `Keyboard` component from `react-aria-components`. [Docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/Keyboard.html#keyboard) -->

The underlying element is a `kbd` HTML element. [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/kbd) -->
