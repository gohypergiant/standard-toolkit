# Accordion Group
The Accordion Group component combines provides a convenient grouping for Accordion components. Use this component when you need a series of related Accordions that all track together in size and behavior. It supports both single and multiple expanded items.

## Example usage

### Basic
```tsx
// Accordion group with multiple items
<AccordionGroup allowsMultipleExpanded={true}>
  <Accordion>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <AccordionTrigger>
        <Icon><Settings /></Icon>
        Settings
      </AccordionTrigger>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <p>Settings configuration options...</p>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <AccordionTrigger>
        <Icon><Help /></Icon>
        Help
      </AccordionTrigger>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <p>Help documentation...</p>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<Canvas of={AccordionGroupStories.Default} />

## Variants
* **cozy** - Standard size with larger text and spacing (default)
* **compact** - Smaller size with reduced text and spacing for space-constrained layouts

### AccordionGroup Props
The Accordion supports all the `Disclosure Group` [props and events from `react-aria-components`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html#disclosuregroup-1) and
* **`variant`** - Global variant for all child accordions.

See [Accordion](?path=/docs/components-accordion--playground) for details on props for individual sections.

## Implementation Notes
The `AccordionGroup` component wraps the `DisclosureGroup` component from `react-aria-components`. [Docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html)
